# Decision MetaMamba


## Instructions
You need to install the metamamba library first using pip.
Use the following command for installation:
```
cd path-to-DMM/mamba
python setup.py install
```
After the installation is complete, you can train each dataset using the run.sh script.

To test the Kitchen environment, it is necessary to ensure that the dm_control package version is compatible with the installed MuJoCo version.
The package versions used in experiments are specified in the requirements.txt.
